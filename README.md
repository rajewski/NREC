# NREC Questions

My intent for this repo is to document an analysis I am doing into tree removals in South Pasadena over the period of about a year. I became interested in this data after I became a commissioner on the South Pas NREC and first encountered the tree ordinance in a meaningful way. 

I began to wonder how the ordinance was being enforced across the city.
-  Since the ordinance relies on neighbor comment, I expect that more densely populated areas will have more permits that are contested. Perhaps I can integrate with census/ACS data to get the population on a finer scale?
-  I also know that if tree cover differs across the city, and I suspect it does, that will affect the number of permits that could even theoretically be issued. I don't know if South Pasadena has a detailed tree survey of private land, but perhaps I can use some sort of proxy of vegetative cover or tree cover from a public database.
-  Are certain arborists more permissive of removals?
-  Are certain species or sizes of trees removed or contested more frequently?

I submitted a public records request (PRA #R000168-040225) for all tree permits in the city between 1/1/2024 and 3/31/2025. The request included the permit applications themselves as well as the arborist reports. The request has been fulfilled and I and going to organize the files manually as best I can.
